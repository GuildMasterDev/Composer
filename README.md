## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/guildmasterdev/Composer.git
cd Composer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Rebuild native modules for Electron (required for SQLite)
npx electron-rebuild

# Compile TypeScript files for main process
npm run compile:main

# Start the application in development mode
npm run dev
```

The application will open automatically. The first time you run it, it will create a local database and populate it with initial DAW and plugin data.

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode
```bash
# Start with hot-reload for development
npm run dev
```

This runs both the Vite development server (for the React frontend) and the Electron app concurrently.

#### Production Build

```bash
# Build for your current platform
npm run build

# The built application will be in the dist-electron folder
# - Windows: .exe installer
# - macOS: .dmg file  
# - Linux: .AppImage file
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with native modules:
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npx electron-rebuild
npm run compile:main
```

If the app doesn't start:
```bash
# Check that port 5173 is free (used by Vite)
lsof -i :5173

# Compile main process files manually
npm run compile:main

# Then try running again
npm run dev
```
